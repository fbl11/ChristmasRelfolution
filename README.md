# Christmas rELFolution!

Welcome to the rELFolution!

The elves are up in arms over poor pay and long Christmas working hours! Using your trusty gingerbread HR team and their candycane bribes - try to stop the elves walking out on Christmas eve! YOU MUST SAVE CHRISTMAS!!!


### Project Overview
For our Makers Engineering project 2 we have chosen to build a game using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. We considered using an engine such as Unity to assist but then decided that we would learn much more by coding it by using Vanilla JS. We looked into different types of game to create including 
* .IO
* Simple multiplayer puzzle
* Side scrolling platformer
* Top down racing game
We finally decided on a top down tower defense style game which we could host on Heroku or GitHub pages.
